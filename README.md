# autogen-agents-search-summarize
Agents to help you search and summarize from web searches, empowered by Autogen library

This repo will teach you how to:
- Understand basic concepts of [Autogen library](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/), a framework that enables agentic workflow and multi-agent collaboration

- Build a 'group-chat' agents to illustrate multi-agent collaboration. This group of agents will help research and summarize via web search and LLM.

## Tools you will use
